Use node JS to generate a logo as an image.

# Object-oriented (OOM) Programming Challenge: SVG Logo Generator

My task is to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in user input to generate a logo and save it as SVG file. The application allows users to choose color and shape, provide text for the logo, and save the generated logo into ".svg" file.

# User Story

* As a Bootcamp full-stack web developer
* I WANT to generate a simple logo for my projects
* SO THAT I dont have to hire a graphic designer

# Acceptance Criteria

* GIVEN a comand-line application that accepts user input
* WHEN I am prompted for text
* THEN I can enter any three characters
* WHEN I am prompted for text color
* THEN I can enter a color keyword
* WHEN I am prompted for shape
* THEN I am presented a list of shapes (eg: circle, triangle, square, etc.)
* WHEN I entered all the required inputs
* THEN an SVG file is created and named as "logo SVG"
* AND the output text is printed in the command line
* WHEN I open the file in a browser
* THEN I am shown a 300x200 pixel image that matches the inputs

# Mock-Up

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:
